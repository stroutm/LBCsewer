## Load Balancing Control for Distributed Sewer Assets
Sara Troutman

Multiobjective control of combined sewer storage assets are considered. Upstream points include, but are not limited to, combined sewer overflow basins and in-pipe storage behind inflatable storage dams. For the purposes of testing, downstream points that are considered include local and global relative to controlled assets. For downstream objectives, both flow and total suspended solids (TSS) are considered. Loading balancing control is used to control sewer assets based on system-wide water quantity and quality objectives.
