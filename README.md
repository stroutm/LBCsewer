## Market-Based Control for Distributed Sewer Assets

\begin{equation*}
upstream demand = -price + beta (upstream capacity)
\end{equation*}

downstream supply = price + epsilon (downstream flow capacity - flow setpoint) + zeta (downstream TSS capacity - TSS setpoint)

demand = supply
-> price

demand(price) -> action
