## Market-Based Control for Distributed Sewer Assets
Sara Troutman

Multiobjective control of combined sewer storage assets are considered. Upstream points include, but are not limited to, combined sewer overflow basins and in-pipe storage behind inflatable storage dams. For the purposes of testing, downstream points that are considered include local and global relative to controlled assets. For downstream objectives, both flow and total suspended solids (TSS) are considered. Market-based control is used to control sewer assets based on system-wide supply and demand for water quantity and quality objectives.

* Upstream demand is a linear function of price (inversely proportional) and current upstream capacity (proportionality constant beta) in storage units (e.g., storage tanks, conduits behind inflatable storage dams).
* Downstream supply is a linear function of price (proportional) and current downstream flow and TSS capacity (proportionality constants epsilon and zeta, respectively). Note that these capacities are considered around given flow and TSS setpoints.
* Aggregated (summed) upstream demand is set equal to downstream supply to determine the current system price for capacity.
* Based on the relative demands for each upstream asset, control actions are made.
